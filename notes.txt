In order to run a script both the script and the directory(ies ?) above it require +x permission.

.profile is read only for an interactive login shell.

Linux reads from one of these files, checking in the following order:
1. ~/.bash_profile
2. ~/.bash_login
3. ~/.profile

/etc/environment contains environment variables for all users.

Setting PATH in /etc/environment may not work because other scripts may overwrite it (that is the case for example on Debian).

Environment variables for specific users should be located in their .bashrcs.
