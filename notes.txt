In order to run a script both the script and the directory(ies ?) above it require +x permission.

.profile is read only for an interactive login shell.

Linux reads from one of these files, checking in the following order:
1. ~/.bash_profile
2. ~/.bash_login
3. ~/.profile

/etc/environment contains environment variables for all users.

Setting PATH in /etc/environment may not work because other scripts may overwrite it (that is the case for example on Debian).

Environment variables for specific users should be located in their .bashrcs.

Git keeps track of only executable permissions.

'source script_path' allows the script_path to access variables from the calling script.
